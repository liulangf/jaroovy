/**
 * From <<Addison.Wesley.Software.Architecture.In.Practice.2nd.Edition>>.
 * 
 * An architecture is a description of system structures, of which there are several 
 * (module decomposition, process, deployment, layered, etc.). 
 * 
 * Architecture is the first artifact that can be analyzed to determine how well its quality attributes 
 * are being achieved, and it also serves as the project blueprint. 
 * 
 * An architecture serves as the vehicle for communication, is the manifestation of the earliest design 
 * decisions, and is a re-usable abstraction that can be transferred to new systems. 
 * 
 * These are the things we mean when we use the word architecture.
